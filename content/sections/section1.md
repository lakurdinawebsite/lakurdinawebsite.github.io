## About Lakurdina

On this site, I and a few contributors publish articles on subjects of interest to us. Sometimes they relate to current affairs, sometimes to history and our place within it, sometimes to topics of controversy within our time; however most often they are simply on subjects that are on their authors' minds.  

Our aim is to challenge common and established views where we feel that they lack sanity, whilst retaining a strong basis in reality. We hope that readers will find our articles thought provoking, and appreciate them as such.  

For general writings, please visit [Articles](https://articles.lakurdina.com). For thoughts on meteorology, as well as weather information and data, see [Weather](https://weather.lakurdina.com).
