## About Lakurdina

We are a small collective publishing articles on subjects that interest us. Sometimes they relate to current affairs, sometimes to history and our place within it, sometimes to topics of controversy within our time; however most often they are simply on subjects that are on their authors minds at the time.  

Our aim is to challenge common and established views, whilst retaining a strong basis in the realities of the World. We hope that readers will find our articles thought provoking, and appreciate them as such.
