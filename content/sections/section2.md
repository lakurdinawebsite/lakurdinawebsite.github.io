## Who We Are

Who I am is of no importance. Well it is to me, but I believe it should have no significance to readers. My words, and those of contributors, should speak for themselves.  

I do believe, however, that some contextual information is important, and so a small amount is provided below.

- Goldilocks - This is me: administrator of the Lakurdina website, writer, ocasional poet. Particular interests include meteorology, education and the insanities of our world. The Weather section of the site is my pet project.

In time, other contributors may choose to include information about themselves, but at this time no-one has.  

Oh, and if you are wondering about our name, it means "Blue Lake". The word has a poetic sound, which appeals to me. There is no more to it than that.
