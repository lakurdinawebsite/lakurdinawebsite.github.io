## Who We Are

Who we are is of no importance. Well it is to us, but I believe it should have no significance to readers. My words, and those of contributors, should speak for themselves.  

I do believe, however, that some contextual information is important, and so a small amount is provided below.

- Goldilocks - This is me: administrator of the Lakurdina website, writer, ocasional poet. Particular interests include meteorology, education and the insanities of our world. The Weather section of the site is my pet project.

- OS - Contributor to the Education section of the website. Interested in all matters concerning education and child development, with particular focus on the problems raised by the modern World.

- Christina - Contributor of short stories. Lover of victorian ghost stories. Author (if the word is not too pretentious).

In time, other contributors may choose to include information about themselves, but at this time no-one has.  

Oh, and if you are wondering about our name, it means "Blue Lake". The word is nice to say. There is no more to it than that.
