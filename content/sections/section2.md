## Who We Are

Who we are is of no importance. Well it is to us, but we believe it should have no significance to readers. Our words should speak for themselves.  

Nevertheless, for those who really want it, here is a bit about each of us:  

- OS - Site administrator. Has a strong interest in meteorology and education. These sections of the site are his pet projects.
- DN - Journalist and occasional contributor. Has very strong, and often unpopular, opinions on many subjects, but predominantly writes on issues of equality and tolerance.
- EH - Known by his friends as a philosopher. Writes predominantly on issues relating to the nature of philosophy and the human condition.
- DB - Environmental Scientist. Frequently annoyed by the lack of common sense in science. Writes predominantly on issues relating to science and meteorology.
- Others - Published under the name Goldilocks. Occasional and one-off contributors giving broader perspectives on the issues.
